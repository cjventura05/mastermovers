        </div>
        <div class="about-right">
            <p>MasterMovers was born out of the desire to improve the Filipinos’ shopping experience. We envision a
                world where Filipino shoppers have access to products anytime, anywhere, and Filipino Micro, Small and
                medium (MSMEs) owners are empowered to dominate the business world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Displeased with the long waiting time when it comes to ordering products online, MasterMovers seeks to
                offer a better shopping experience for Filipinos by connecting with several business owners and having a
                same-day delivery system.
            </p>
            <p>
                At MasterMovers, we seek to give opportunities to Filipinos- may they be consumers, business owners, or
                riders. Launched in July 2022, MasterMovers works with a team of hardworking, innovative problem-solvers
                who are determined to create an app that connects consumers with Filipino businesses.
